## **Description**

_A JavaScript Application that utilizes API's which will allow a user to search for hiking trails nearby with their respective location. Data is gathered from various databases via APIs and providing both nearby trails based on geolocation, as well as the respective weather for that day at a particular location._

## **Specs**

A user can input a distance in miles with a specific date and the program returns a list of 10 nearby hikes with detailed information, weather conditions and a google maps directions link based on user inputted criteria.

If a user cannot find a desired trail in the search hikes nearby list, the user can search for a specific place by inputting the name in the search destination search bar, and get redirected to Google Maps, with the user's current location and destination already gathered.
